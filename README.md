📋 Project Description
    The Weather App allows users to input a city name and view the current weather conditions including temperature, description, and an icon representation.
    It strengthens skills in API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, responsive design, and error handling.

🚀 Technologies Used
    HTML5 – Structure and layout.
    
    CSS3 – Styling and responsive design.
    
    JavaScript (ES6+) – Logic, API handling, and DOM manipulation.
    
    OpenWeatherMap API – To fetch live weather data.

🎯 Features
    🔍 User Input: Enter a city or location name.
    
    🌡️ Weather Data Display: Temperature (°C), weather description (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy), and weather icon.
    
    🚫 Error Handling: Displays user-friendly messages for invalid locations or API errors.
    
    🎨 Responsive UI: Optimized for desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

⚙️ How It Works
    Users input a city name and click the Submit button.
